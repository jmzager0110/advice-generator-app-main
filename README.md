## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
### What I learned

This was an excellent refresher on JavaScript, one example is with event listener (which was the key to making me finally appreciate JavaScript).

Also, I finally feel like I have a good handle at custom variables in css!

### Continued development

I found a [CSS to Sass converter](https://codebeautify.org/css-to-sass-converter) online; This does feel like a shortcut due to my undying love for stylin', so going forward, I really want to implement Sass!

Continued Development in Continued Deployment, I have about 5 personal sites I'm failing at working on at the same time to really get all option of deployment down, thankfully these Code Challenges encourage the use of CodePen. But this is another area I really want to focus on for the next round.
### Useful resources

- [This popular solution on GitHub](https://github.com/catherineisonline/advice-generator-app-frontendmentor) - This user's solution really helped when I got stuck, plus her use of tags on GitHub is awesome, so I'm saving that for future reference!
- [Pixel to Rem Converter](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter) - This is one thing I'm using to help achieve results for mobile.
