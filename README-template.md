## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg) TODO:

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

This was an excellent refresher on JavaScript, one example is with event listener (which was the key to making me finally appreciate JavaScript).

TODO

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

I found a [CSS to Sass converter](https://codebeautify.org/css-to-sass-converter) online; that does feel like a shortcut due to my undying love for stylin'. 

Continued Development in Continued Deployment, I have about 5 personal sites I'm failing at working on at the same time to really get all option of deployment down, thankfully these Code Challenges encourage the use of CodePen. But this is another area I really want to focus on for the next round.

### Useful resources

- [This popular solution on GitHub](https://github.com/catherineisonline/advice-generator-app-frontendmentor) - This user's solution really helped when I got stuck, plus her use of tags on GitHub is awesome, so I'm saving that for future reference!
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
